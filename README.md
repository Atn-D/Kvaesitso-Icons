**This is my personal fork with all commits from [Lawnicons](https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnicons) and some icons add by me.**

Kvaesitso Icons is an add-on for adding themed icons to [Kvaesitso](https://github.com/MM2-0/Kvaesitso).
This addon is now the source of all themed icons, for simplicity.
